            <h2>What is Aquascaping?</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to our site.  Perhaps you have been fishkeeping for some time and have become 
                intrigued at the possibility of having a tank that supports both flora (plants) 
                and fauna (animals)?
            </p>
            <p>
                It is our hope to introduce you to the basic concepts of aquascaping from the 
                materials used to some differnent styles that achieve pleasing results.  
                These are by no means exhaustive!
            </p>
            <p>
                To paraphrase James Findley, a veteran of the hobby,
                "Aquascaping is the art of arranging and maintaining aquatic plants,
                as well as natural materials such as stone and wood in an aesthetically
                pleasing manner withing an aquarium"
            </p>    
            <p>
                With some dedication and research you too could get to enjoy a fully 
                realised  natural aquarium.  
                Not only will it boost your mental wellbeing and enjoyment, 
                it will provide a focal point within your home that visitors and neighbours 
                will be envious off! 
            </p>

            <h2>Components</h2>
            <p>
                There are 3 main parts to building a scape before we even consider plants.
                Collectively they are called hardscape. A 'strong' hardscape makes for a more
                dramatic finish.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rock forms the relief, wood can provide the viewer perspective if placed correctly
                and substrate provide a grounding.  Think of your scape as a miniturised hillside 
                vista with a forest growing upon it.
            </p>
                <section class="components-wood">
                    <h3>Wood</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are various types of wood that look good in the aquarium.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                    The most popular species are redmoor, mopani, maznanita, bonzai, bogwood
                     and azalea to name but a few.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Adding wood to your aquarium provides aesthetic benefits which can really 
                        transform the look of your tank. 
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                         Wood offers other significant benefits. It can give secretive species 
                         of fish and invertebrates a place to live and hide and serve as a spawning 
                         site for their young. It can even provide a food source for microscopic 
                         animals such as algae. 
                         These creatures help maintain a stable water chemistry often lacking in 
                         livestock only tanks which tend to rely on more expensive man-made additives.

                    <h3>Rock</h3>
                    <p>
                        To create a visually pleasing aquarium a good hardscape is essential.  
                        Rock is the mainstay of the hardscape and comes in many forms.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        Make sure the stone used isn't reactive or it will alter your water 
                        chemistry.  For example limestone is calcium carbonate and will soften your
                         water too much over time leading to more water changes and 
                         general maintenance.  
                    </p>   
                    <p>    
                        Go for tried and tested types such as Mountainstone, Seiryu, Woodstone or 
                        Okho that looks like dragon scales! 
                        These are all available at specialist stockists. They can be expensive so do 
                        choose wisely.  That being said a good hardscape is an investment so don't 
                        be deterred from buying more than you think you will need!
