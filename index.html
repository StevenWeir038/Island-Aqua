            <h2>What is Aquascaping?</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to our site.  Perhaps you have been fishkeeping for some time and have become 
                intrigued at the possibility of having a tank that supports both flora (plants) 
                and fauna (animals)?
            </p>
            <p>
                It is our hope to introduce you to the basic concepts of aquascaping from the 
                materials used to some different styles that achieve pleasing results.  
                These are by no means exhaustive!
            </p>
            <p>
                To paraphrase James Findley, a veteran of the hobby,
                <quote>"Aquascaping is the art of arranging and maintaining aquatic plants,
                as well as natural materials such as stone and wood in an aesthetically
                pleasing manner within an aquarium"</quote>
            </p>    
            <p>
                With some patience and research you too could get to enjoy a fully 
                realised  natural aquarium.  
                Not only will it boost your mental wellbeing and enjoyment, 
                it will provide a focal point within your home that visitors and neighbours 
                will be envious off!

            <h2>Components</h2>
            <p>
                There are 3 main parts to building a scape before we even consider plants.
                Collectively they are called <em>hardscape</em>. A strong hardscape makes for a more
                dramatic finish.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rock forms the relief, wood can provide the viewer perspective if placed correctly
                and substrate provides a grounding.  Think of your scape as a miniturised hillside 
                vista with a forest growing upon it.
            </p>

                    <h3>Wood</h3>
                    <img class="images" src="assets/images/wood.jpg" 
                        alt="Photograph of a piece of azalea wood">
                    <p>
                        There are various types of wood that look good in the aquarium.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                    The most popular species are redmoor, mopani, maznanita, bonzai, bogwood
                     and azalea to name but a few.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Adding wood to your aquarium provides aesthetic benefits which can really 
                        transform the look of your tank. 
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                         Wood can also give secretive species 
                         of fish and invertebrates a place to live and hide and serve as a spawning 
                         site for their young. It can even provide a food source for microscopic 
                         animals such as algae. 
                         These creatures help maintain a stable water chemistry often lacking in 
                         livestock only tanks which tend to rely on more expensive man-made additives.

                    <p>
                        To create a visually pleasing aquarium a good hardscape is essential. I know I am repeating myself.  
                        Rock is the mainstay of the hardscape and comes in many forms.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        Make sure the stone used isn't reactive or it will alter your water 
                        chemistry.  For example limestone is calcium carbonate and will soften your
                         water too much over time leading to more water changes and 
                         general maintenance.  
                    </p>   
                    <p>    
                        Go for tried and tested types such as Mountainstone, Seiryu, Woodstone or 
                        Okho that looks like dragon scales! 
                        These are all available at specialist stockists. They can be expensive so do 
                        choose wisely.  That being said a good hardscape is an investment so don't 
                        be deterred from buying more than you think you will need!

                    <p>
                        A natural tank needs a medium on its base.  As aquascaping uses live plants 
                        it's recommend to use aquasoil as opposed to sand or gravel as plants 
                        require nutrients and a medium to develop a root network.  
                        It is possible to have a planted tank and add liquid CO2 etc though this 
                        takes away from the aesthetic which is the whole point of aquascaping.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We recommend <em>not</em> using natural soils from your garden if you are 
                        just starting out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For decorative purposes sand, gravels of varying grades can be used to
                        <em>split</em> the scape up into different areas.
                        You can see this effect when viewing some of the different styles not yet covered on this site such 
                        as islands and dioramas.

        <h2>Styles</h2>
        <p>
            To achieve an appealing result it is best to follow a particular 
            aquascaping style. Below are three of the most common styles you’ll see in aquariums.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <section class="styles-dutch">
            <h3>Dutch</h3>
            <img class="images"  src="assets/images/dutch-style.jpg" 
            alt="Photograph of dutch style aquascape">
            <p>
                This style is characterized by many different types of plants with multiple leaf types. 
                It’s commonly seen with raised ‘layers’, or terraces, known as Dutch ‘streets’.
            </p>
            <p>
                The floor is covered with carpeting plants with taller plants lining the back of 
                the tank. Most noticeably, Dutch tanks utilise less hardscape so the plants really take centre stage.
            </p>

        </section>

        <section class="styles-iwagumi">
            <h3>Iwagumi</h3>
            <img class="images"  src="assets/images/iwagumi-style.jpg" 
            alt="Photograph of iwagumi style aquascape with rock placement names">
            <p>
                Inspired by the late Takashi Amano, iwagumi is one of the most 
                popular aquascaping styles today. It is characterized by a 
                series of stones arranged according to the Rule of Thirds.
            </p>
            <p>
                There should always be an odd number of stones to prevent the layout from ‘balancing’, since
                 the human eye always tries to see a ‘split’ in balanced layouts.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are at least three stones: a larger ‘Father’ stone, and at least two secondary stones. 
                There can be more, so long as the total number remains odd.
            </p>
            <p>
                These tanks may imitate a natural landscape, with a common theme of simplicity and open space.
                 There are limited colors in plants & stone, and the number of varying flora and fauna is kept 
                 to a minimum to create minimalism.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scale is very important in this style. The father stone should be the largest object in the 
                aquarium.
            </p>

        </section>

        <hr>

        <section class="styles-nature">
            <h3>Nature</h3>
            <img class="images"  src="assets/images/nature-style.jpg" 
            alt="Photograph of nature style aquascape">
            <p>
                Nature styles make for breathtaking tanks. These tanks seek to recreate various terrestrial 
                landscapes—hills, mountains, valleys, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
                These can be categorized into various substyles, like the ‘island’ type, which features 
                a stone ‘mountain’, or mound in the middle, or the triangular type, where the substrate and 
                genearl flow the tank slopes down from one corner of the tank.
            </p>

    <section id="fish" class="fish">
        <h2>Fish</h2>
        <p>
            Typically the focal point of an aquarium is its fish.  However in aquascaping the design and plants are the main focal point. 
            Fish do play a complimentary role and can enhance the character of the tank.
            As always we should be careful what fish to select as they may eat your carefully cultivated plants and prey upon other smaller 
            species of fish or invertebrate. A general rule of thumb to follow is if it fits in a fishes mouth it can and will be eaten!
            We recommend smaller peaceful communty fish that display shoaling behaviours which is pleasant to view. 
            Just make sure to have at least a dozen in your tank or they will becaome stressed and that you tank in large enough to support their numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another popular addition to a planted community aquarium are shrimp.  These 'inverts' are also varied and act as a clean up crew for uneaten 
            food that sinks to the bottom and eat algae to help keep your scape pristine.

                Cardinal tetras are a popular,  active schooling fish live peacefully shoal in a community aquarium.
            </p>
            <p>
            In the wild they naturally live in slow moving water in shaded conditions beneeth foliage so try to 
            replicate this in your tank using floating plants.  Also it is good to give them an open water swimming area.
            </p>
            <p>
            Their main characteristic is a striking red band along their body.  This marking contrasts well against a background of green plants.

            When breeding these fish build impressive bubble nests to protect their eggs and hatched fry.

            Be sure to suppliment their flake food diet with some frozen foods like daphnia or even a 
            worm from the garden!

            Amano shrimp are and extremely easy to care for. They are a social so keep them in groups of at least three. 
            It is entertaining to watch them all scuttling around together, going over plants, swimming around and snatching 
            food right from under a fish’s nose, and then swimming off to go eat it away from the others.
        </p>
        <p>
            They are some of the best algae eaters in existence. They’ll take care of that nasty hair algae, 
            unlike any other shrimp species.

            Neocaridina come in a variety of colors from red to yellow to blue and have three pattern types. 
            The most common type is a solid colored red shrimp, hence the name “red cherry”. This are the easiest 
            shrimp to care for with one caveat.  They eat biofilm so don't put them in your aquarium until it is 
            well established or they will have nothing to eat.
