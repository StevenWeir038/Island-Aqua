#### Landing page
The *landing page* hero background is designed to draw the user into the topic as a picture paints a thousand words.
As a hobby, a good aquascape is aesthetically pleasing therefore conveys an implicit message to the visitor.
Note the subtle use of greyscale fading into the standard contrast to emphasise the beauty of nature.
